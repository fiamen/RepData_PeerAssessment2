**Synopsis**: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.

**Data Processing**:  which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.

**Results**: in which your results are presented.

**other sections**: in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
